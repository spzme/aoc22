##### AOC 22

### This is my attempt at learning Rust by solving (some of) the problems presented in the Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) of 2022.

### The aim is to learn solving new problems and to get more accustomed to Rust, as well as some of the Visual Studio Code extensions for Rust.
